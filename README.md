### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name's Peter Prescott. I'm married with four kids :)

Although English by descent, I spent most of my childhood in Asia (born in the Philippines, then parents moved to Singapore and sent me to boarding schools in Malaysia and India), before going to Cambridge University, where I studied Mathematics and Theology.

I'm now a <strike>Machine Learning Engineer at [Mellizyme Biotechnology](https://www.mellizyme.com)</strike> Data Scientist at [Ninety Percent Of Everything](https://www.90poe.io).

I'm also trying to do a PhD part-time at Liverpool University's Geographic Data Science Lab, researching *geodemographics* -- basically, unsupervised machine learning applied to sociospatial big data. The PhD program has included an integrated Masters with various taught modules, and you can see the various assignments I've done [here](https://github.com/peterprescott/data-science).
